# Shoot'Up

This game is a **Roguelike** and also a **Shooter**, where the player shoots by his feet, with an 8 round magazine. To reload the magazine, all you need to do is go to the ground or hit an enemy by jumping on them.

The objective is to eliminate as many enemies as possible to improve his score, which can be infinite. In addition, you have to go down as much as possible in the map to generate new enemies, because it is not possible to go back.

## Bestiary :
The bestiary is composed of 5 Mobs with 2 variants :
- 🐛 | **Worm** (Patrol)
- 🔪 | **Goblin** (Fast)
- 🍄 | **Mushroom** (Strong)
- 🍮 | **The Slime** (Jump high)
- 🦇 | **Blue & Red Bat** (Flight)

Each enemy drop a random number of "Gem", which allows to indicate the score of the player. You also have a 10% chance to have an enemy drop a "Health Potion" that heals you for 1 HP.

## The controls are only with the arrow keys :

-   Up Arrow : Jump & Shoot
-   Left / Right Arrow : Move
-   Down Arrow : Go down from platforms
